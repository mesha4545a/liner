# Linear Algebra Assignment P5
Use your Jupyterlab environment and numpy from your MatrixDS project to solve the attached systems of equations. What values do you get for x and y for each?

```
3x + 5y = 6
7x - 5y = 9

```
```
x + y + z = 6
y + z = -4
2x + 5y - z = 27

```

```
x + y = 4
2x + 2y = 8

```
